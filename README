Chess-Game engine is an AI for computational chess

It has implemented the representations of the board and of the move
To simplify the work of moving peaces, we decided to sepparate the objects
representation from the actual algorithms ( such as finding all the possible 
moves of a piece ) by implementing the additional class helper which implemets
exactly those moves.

At the start of the application, an instance of the bootstrapper class is
created ( which initializes all the components and applyes the initial
settings ).

The bootstrapper class then creates a game class, which is responsible for
responding to the events issued by the Xboard.


A quick map of the project:

application -> bootstrapper -> game -> board 
                                   -> stdProtocol
